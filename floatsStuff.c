    Declare a "typedef struct {} flt;" to contain data for a float
    The data should include:
        An integer for the sign
            (1 for positive, -1 for negative)
        An integer for the exponent value
            (should be bit value to integer minus BIAS or -126 for denormalized)
        A float to contain the value of the mantissa
            (Actual float value extracted from the binary value)
        An integer to contain the mode using the defines above
            (NORM, DNORM and SPEC)
    Example after processing: -15.375 = 1 10000010 11101100000000000000000
